#All Is Well

###A web application designed to assist therapists improve mental health treatment through understanding the well-being of their clients beyond the appointment.

##Synopsis
####A user of All Is Well is either a client or a therapist. User signup allows for a client to enter their basic information, in addition to specifying who their therapist is. Once a client is logged in, they may write journal entries, complete a mood survey, read their therapist's shared notes, or post a significant emotional event for the therapist's viewing. A therapist can write notes the client or themself, in addition to view events and journal entries submitted by the client.

###Client Journal Entries
####All is Well provides clients with a journaling outlet with a shared or private feature. Shared entries are viewable by the client's therapist, whereas private entries are limited to the client's viewing.

----

###Client Mood Surveys
####All is Well encourages clients to complete a short survey intended to provide their therapist with insight into the feelings a client is experiencing. The therapist can then view each answer to the survey.

----

###Client Events
####A client may document moments of significant emotional impact. An event is documented with a date, nature (positive, negative, or neutral), and description. The submitted event then appears on the therapist's calendar. The intention of this feature is to allow a therapist to recognize behavior patterns and to view the intensity and nature of the events.

----

###Therapist Notes
####Therapist notes function as a note given to a client at the end of a session. For example, a note may be a reminder to meditate, to set aside alone time, or to recite a mantra on an outside walk. A therapist note may be shared with the client, or private for the therapist's own reference.
